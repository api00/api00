### ✦ The Manifesto

I don't just write code; I build businesses. I believe in the power of **Micro-SaaS**, 
the transparency of **Building in Public**, and the art of the **Minimal Viable Product**. 
Currently focusing on bridging the gap between complex AI and everyday utility.

### 📊 Shipping Dashboard
